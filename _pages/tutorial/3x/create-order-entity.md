Next, we will create an Order entity, following the same procedure we used to create the Product entity. 

Click **Entities** on the top navigation bar, and then follow these steps:

1. Click <span class="circle-button"><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i></span> to open the entity tools control.
1. Click **New Entity**. The entity creation dialog appears.
1. Type **Order** in the Title field.
1. Click **SAVE**. The new Order entity is displayed. If you are prompted to update the index, click No.

You have just created your second entity, the Order entity.

Note: If you do not see your Order entity, it might be hidden behind the Product entity. Click and drag the Product entity to uncover the Order entity.

The following picture summarizes the steps for creating the Order entity.
